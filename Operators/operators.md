### **Operators Precedence and Associativity in Programming**

When writing expressions in programming, multiple operators can appear in a single statement. To determine how these operators are evaluated, **operator precedence** and **associativity** come into play.

---

## **1. Operator Precedence**

Operator precedence determines the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression. Operators with **higher precedence** are evaluated first before operators with **lower precedence**.

### **Example:**

```python
result = 10 + 5 * 2
print(result)  # Output: 20
```

### **Explanation:**

-  `*` (Multiplication) has higher precedence than `+` (Addition).
-  So, `5 * 2` is evaluated first, resulting in `10 + 10`, which gives `20`.

---

## **2. Operator Associativity**

When two operators have the **same precedence**, the **associativity** rule determines the direction in which they are evaluated.

### **Types of Associativity:**

1. **Left to Right Associativity** (Most operators)

   -  Operators are evaluated from **left to right**.
   -  Example: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `==`, `&&`, `||`
   -  **Example:**
      ```python
      result = 100 / 10 * 2
      print(result)  # Output: 20.0
      ```
      **Explanation:** Since `/` and `*` have the same precedence and are left-to-right associative, `100 / 10` is evaluated first, giving `10 * 2 = 20.0`.

2. **Right to Left Associativity** (Some operators)
   -  Operators are evaluated from **right to left**.
   -  Example: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `**` (Exponentiation in Python)
   -  **Example:**
      ```python
      x = y = 10  # Right to left
      print(x, y)  # Output: 10 10
      ```
      **Explanation:** `y = 10` is evaluated first, then `x = y`.

## **3. Operator Precedence Table**

Hereâ€™s a table of common operators in Python, ordered from **highest** to **lowest** precedence:

| Precedence      | Operator(s)                                              | Description                       | Associativity        |

| **7**           | `&`                                                      | Bitwise AND                       | Left to Right        |
| **8**           | `^`                                                      | Bitwise XOR                       | Left to Right        |
| **9**           | `                                                        | `                                 | Bitwise OR           | Left to Right |

## **4. Examples and Explanations**

### **Example 1: Using Parentheses to Control Precedence**

```python
result = (10 + 5) * 2
print(result)  # Output: 30
```

-  Parentheses force `10 + 5` to be evaluated first, so `15 * 2 = 30`.

### **Example 2: Exponentiation and Negation**

```python
print(-3 ** 2)  # Output: -9
```

-  `**` has higher precedence than `-`, so `3 ** 2` is evaluated first (`9`), then `-9`.

---

## **5. Key Takeaways**

1. **Higher precedence operators** are evaluated before lower precedence ones.
2. **Associativity** decides the order when multiple operators of the same precedence exist.
3. **Parentheses** override precedence and are useful for clarity.
4. **Right-to-left operators** include assignment (`=`) and exponentiation (`**`).
5. **Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)** have lower precedence than comparison operators (`==`, `<`, `>`).
